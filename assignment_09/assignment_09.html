                <h3>Oleksandr "⁠s1mple" Kostyliev</h3>
                <p>Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev makes history as the first three-time HLTV Player of the Year, presented by 1xBet, after earning five EVPs, two MVPs, and powering NAVI to a trophy and two Elite Event grand finals in 2022.</p>
                <p>s1mple has done it again! The Ukrainian superstar has broken another record by becoming the first player to be named the best in the world three times, twice on the trot, as he leaves behind two-time back-to-back winners Christopher "⁠GeT_RiGhT⁠" Alesund, Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David, and Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut. His impressive first placings in Top 20 Players of the Year rankings are also part of an incredible five years among the top two best players in the world, trailing behind only ZywOo in 2019 and during the online era in 2020.The 25-year-old, who has been in the top 20 Players of the Year ranking for seven years running now, kept an at times struggling Natus Vincere going deep in tournaments throughout 2022 with world-beating individual performances, which included five EVPs and two MVPs to stand above the rest of the field and complete the historical feat.</p>

                <h3>Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut </h3>
                <p>Immense overall statistics and the most convincing MVP performance of the year earn Mathieu "⁠ZywOo⁠" Herbaut back-to-back second-place finishes in the HLTV Top 20 Players of the Year ranking, powered by 1xBet.</p>
                <p>ZywOo was a lauded talent before he even began his career proper, already receiving nods from the likes of French legend Richard "⁠shox⁠" Papillon as early as 2017. The young AWPer delayed his entry into the upper echelons of CS in order to finish school but in the meantime wrought havoc on the French sub-top scene, as evidenced by his stunning performances in the ESL National Championship Summer 2018 where his squad took the title. He finally stepped into tier-one by joining Vitality late in 2018 and wasted no time in providing his pedigree, carrying the squad to the DreamHack Open Atlanta title in his first notable LAN. Since then ZywOo has been one of the premier superstar talents in CS:GO, regularly putting in the kind of tournament performances that lesser players can only dream of and constantly battling Oleksandr "⁠s1mple⁠" Kostyliev for the mantle of best player in the world. He has twice won that battle, in his first full year as a pro in 2019 and then again in 2020, but he was knocked off that pedestal by his Ukrainian counterpart in 2021.</p>

                <h3>Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov</h3>
                <p>Dmitry "⁠sh1ro⁠" Sokolov breaks into the top three of the 2022 edition of our Player of the Year ranking, powered by 1xBet, showing an exceptional floor and recording the highest rating of the year.</p>
                <p>sh1ro returns to the top 20 Players of the Year ranking for the second year running, following up on his fourth-place finish from 2021. The young Russian AWPer was near-unkillable and an excellent clutch player in Gambit's runs to a handful of titles throughout the online stage of the year, and continued his performance upon the return to LAN in July; however, the team's inexperience showed upon reaching the arena stage of top tier tournaments, and they failed to clinch a Big Event title despite consistency putting up solid offline results. sh1ro and Sergey "⁠Ax1Le⁠" Rykhtorov's world-class performances weren't enough to overcome those difficulties and propel Gambit past those hurdles in the latter half of the year, and those struggles deep into the biggest tournaments was an issue that persisted when play resumed in 2022.</p>

                <h3>Sergey "⁠Ax1Le⁠" Rykhtorov</h3>
                <p>Sergey "⁠Ax1Le⁠" Rykhtorov goes one better than 2021 in this HLTV top 20 players of the year ranking by 1xBet after delivering monstrous performances against the strongest opposition and earning an MVP in his first-ever Big Event win.</p>
                <p>Ax1Le makes a return to the top 20 players of the year for the second time in a row since Gambit's rise to the top accelerated in 2021. They even became the team to beat, but their online success did not immediately translate to LAN when offline play returned in the latter half of the year despite the youngsters still holding their own. "Regarding young teams, I think the most important thing is to gather in one place the right kind of people and give them everything that they need to grow: good conditions, good PCs, devices, good coaching staff that is fully interested in their project, and, of course, full support from an organisation. All that gave us an opportunity to grow into men that fought for a place in the top 30 with blood and sweat and become the players we are today."</p>

                <h3>Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač</h3>
                <p>Superb impact in the server combined with consistently excellent performances throughout the year put Nikola "⁠NiKo⁠" Kovač fifth in the Top 20 players of 2022 ranking powered by 1xBet.</p>
                <p>NiKo has been a staple at the top of CS:GO since bursting into the scene in 2015 with MOUZ, when his exploits on the server earned him worldwide recognition following his move from iNation. It was alongside the German organization that the Bosnian star earned his first cap in the HLTV Top 20 players of the year ranking after he was named the 11th best player of 2016 following several excellent performances in a dysfunctional squad. It was not long until his efforts earned him a move to another team and almost two years after his arrival at MOUZ, NiKo received the call to join FaZe in 2017. It was with the European mix that the Bosnian rifler lifted his first trophies as NiKo powered his team to four LAN titles thanks to his immense fragging potential. This put him in the conversation for the best player in the world alongside Marcelo "⁠coldzera⁠" David and he barely missed out on the top spot due to the Brazilian's better record in big playoff matches.</p>
